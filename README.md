# Sales-Analytic# Store Sales Analytics

This project is an in-depth analysis of store sales data using SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to empower sales managers by providing actionable insights to optimize store operations and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The **Store Sales Analytics** project aims to analyze sales data from various retail stores across different U.S. cities. By using SQL and Power BI, we developed an interactive dashboard that provides key insights into store performance, customer behavior, and product sales.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and tables display sales trends, customer behavior, product insights, and employee metrics.
- **Customizable Filters**: Users can slice and dice the data using filters and drill-down features to analyze specific aspects of store performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The dashboard is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring easy navigation for users with minimal experience.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: For data integration, processing, and querying large datasets.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
